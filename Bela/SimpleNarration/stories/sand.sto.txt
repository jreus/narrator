In the cosmology of the Mapuche people of Chile and Argentina, it is possible to decide what you will become after you die. If you enjoy the light given by the noon-day sun; you may become that sun, and be the giver of that light; which is a gift that is given, after all; and has been given many times to you in the past. 

What do you want to become after you die? Do you want to give something to a distant future relative; the feeling of a brisk wind at their back perhaps? Or are you more of an introverted, thoughtful type, and would prefer to be a rock?

When I die I would like to become a grain of sand.

With all due respect to rocks; a rock is a very old being; a piece of the oldest flesh of the earth. A rock is dense with minerals, and in the largest of them are planets and meteorites; far from clumsy, they swing in graceful galactic orbits like gravity's angels.


During the Pleistocene era, large rock formations were revealed by retreating glaciers over the Dutch landscape; thereafter, over a period of millions of years, these rock formations were eroded; grain by grain. The Dutch coast at this moment, free of cliffs and peninsulas, forms one continuous, uniform strip of sand. This configuration is part of the long-tail of this process, from ice, to rock; by wind and water; to sand.

A grain of sand is a very small rock. Rather than dancing in galactic orbits they are moved by forces of water and wind in the company of their brothers and sisters, elder and younger. And by humans, as sand is one of the world's non-renewable resources.

When I die I would like to become a grain of sand.
